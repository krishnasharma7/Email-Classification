# Email-Classification


This is an email classification program written by me. 

I have used the spam assassin data set which has over 5000 examples labeled as spam and not spam. I performed data pre processing on the emails and the final list was then used to train two models:-

1) Random Forest Classifier
2) Naive Bayes Classifier

Both model's accuracies were measured and displayed
